# Macors

来自https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-05-macros.html

We’ve used macros like `println!` throughout this book, but we haven’t fully explored what a macro is and how it works. The term *macro* refers to a family of features in Rust: *declarative* macros with `macro_rules!` and three kinds of *procedural* macros:

- Custom `#[derive]` macros that specify code added with the `derive` attribute used on structs and enums
- Attribute-like macros that define custom attributes usable on any item
- Function-like macros that look like function calls but operate on the tokens specified as their argument

We’ll talk about each of these in turn, but first, let’s look at why we even need macros when we already have functions.

我们已通过这本书像 println! 一样使用了macros，但我们还没有充分探讨什么是一个macro以及它的工作原理。macro 术语指的是一系列rust的特性：带macro_rules! 的 declarative macros (声明式宏) 和 三种 procedural macros (过程宏)：
